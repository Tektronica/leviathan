# Leviathan
Welecome to the Leviathan Test and validation suite for instrumentation measurements!

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create the simplest script launcher I could imagine while incorporating a powerful toolset to capture, analyze, and report data efficiently. Perhaps one of the strongest attributes of this application is its ability to generate full fledged gui test programs composed in Python and capable of running on any desktop environment. 

So, what does it do? It's a...
1. universal script launcher
2. data plotter without needing external tools such as Matlab or Octave
3. instrument setup wizard for easily priortizing which instruments are part of your test
4. power script wizard that can do just about anything*
